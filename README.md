#Qbert

Hey thanks for noticing my game!

After my freshman year of college I decided to make a learning experience out of recreating qbert. It took me much longer than I thought it would (as all programming projects go), but I am very happy to say that I have brought it this far!

Looking back there are so many things I would have done differently, but I designed my code before I knew anything about SDL. Once again, this was a learning exercise and I am happy calling this product "complete".

If you are one of my friends who want to play just shoot me a text/email!

## Building

To build, there are some hints in the CMakeLists.txt file.
Basically, you need to install SDL2, SDL2_gfx and SDL2_mixer

## Deploying

To create an application for friends with Macs, I worked to make a static-library version of the build based on hints from [this blog](https://blog.wasin.io/2018/10/18/statically-build-sdl2-application.html).  Yet another growth experience!
